# Database Benchmarking with JMeter Load Testing

This is a Flask API for the interface between JMeter and the Databases.

## Steps to Run the Server

- `python -m venv env` (This is optional but recommended as this will create a virtual environment for all the dependencies)

- `source env/Scripts/activate` (This will activate the virtual environment, run it if and only if you decided to create the environment)

- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Installs all the necessary dependencies)

- `python app.py` (This will start the server)
